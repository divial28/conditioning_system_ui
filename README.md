Connection is automatic. Conrol UI request all data from system on bootup so you don't need to fo anything. If something goes wrong (status indicators are gray/black) you need to do the following:
* make sure the built-in interface of the air conditioner is working,
* make sure that nothing in your network takes port 5555 which is used to connect remote control with system,
* reboot application
